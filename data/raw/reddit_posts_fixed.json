    "title": "The fact that ChatGPT 5 is barely an improvement shows that AI won't replace software engineers.",
    "content": "I've been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it's evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It's like we're hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.\\n\\nThat's a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn't there yet.\\n\\nSo yeah, the tech is cool and it'll keep getting better, but the progress isn't revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers' lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It's great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won't be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.\\n\\nI know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts?",

If you read the wikibooks chess opening theory on the Sicilian it does that pretty well, that is,m in terms of the logic behind when you defend certain things, bring out certain things at the time you do, branch points where you get to make a decision. I was hoping it could distill that info from the internet for arbitrary lines. But it couldn't even keep track of the lines themselves or valid moves properly\\n    \\n      Mind you this is stuff that's actually REALLY HARD to extract good info from on Google on your own, at least in my experience. there's so much similar info, things that might mention a line in passing but not delve into it, etc. Should be perfect for this use case. I guess the long lines of move notation don't play well with how it tokenizes things?

There are several jobs that AI can already do very well.\n\nSo why are companies so focused on replacing software engineers first?? Why are the first AI agents coming out \"AI programmers\"?\n\nAI is poorly suited for traditional software engineering. It lacks the ability to understand codebase context, handle complex system design, or resolve ambiguous requirements—key parts of an engineer's job. While it performs well on well-defined tasks like coding challenges, it fails with the nuanced, iterative problem-solving real-world development requires.\n\nYet, unlike many mindless desk jobs, or even traditional IT jobs, software engineers seem to be the primary target for AI replacement. Why?? It feels like they just want to get rid of us at this point imo",

My dad is an adjunct professor, he has a huge problem with students turning in AI generated code (his solution is to make homework optional and make everything exam - which he hates doing, since some students won't do the homework and it puts a lot of pressure on those who have test anxiety, but... what else can you do?) who can't explain why their code does what it does or even what the individual parts of it do.\n\nI think we're about to hit a point where the old school problem with people \"faking\" their credentials is about to get 10x worse with people who have real credentials for fake skills.",

Maybe a new AI math structure will be far more accessible to other companies in the future.\n\nTech company labor is dominated by software engineers. Get rid of them and you'll cut no-value-added costs by like 80-95%. No office buildings, office furniture, or office hardware, or janitors for offices needed, or secretaries, or HR, if you have no devs in the office anymore.\n\nErgo, tech company saves a ton of money by automating their labor. Even more money can go into training AI and selling AI (which the AI might be able to sell itself).\n\nAlso, any AI capable of actually replacing a developer (not a copypasta dev, but someone who creates novel solutions to problems using software) is also an AI that can very, very likely be tuned to solve non-coding problems with code.\n\nAI practically flies planes from start to finish. What other things can AI+hardware do that humans already do? Warehouse workers are currently targets, as are drivers, and food makers. Teachers and tutors are already under attack.\n\nCan AI be used to replace those humans, too? Definitely—if it is advanced enough to replace devs, it's advanced enough to replace most people's jobs given the right hardware.\n\nThe only problem these companies have is... they released the right product under the wrong promise. The product that is LLMs is great for what they do, but a farcry from replacing people. They're now all scrambling to prove their LLMs can replace people, like they promised it would. The goalposts on expectations are still getting walked back to, \"Enhancing productivity,\" rather than replacing workers.",

Same as I think it'd be great if we had leagues or a different version of the Olympics that allowed performance enhancing drugs.\\n\\nAI and superhuman leagues would probably not get more popular than the regular leagues, but I think there'd be a niche for them.\\n\\nPro gaming already shows us what this future would look like for sports: the fact that there are AIs that can destroy pros and how the pros themselves can play StarCraft, CSGO, etc with seemingly superhuman abilities doesn't stop others from wanting to compete and the pro leagues aren't more popular than the game is overall in and of itself. But it's still fun and interesting to watch people who can push the limits. Watching bots push the limits is interesting from a technical perspective.\\n\\nAnother more direct analogy is chess. Chess has now been solved for all practical purposes with AI. Top AI can now trounce top grandmasters and even uses tactics and strategies that very experienced players have never seen and wouldn't even be able to even use because they require more working memory than humans, even top players, have. But that'll never stop people from wanting to learn and get really good at it and push themselves to their own inherent",

Fix it for me,** and I just test the code and see if it fixed the bugs, if it does fix the bug then,\n\nI ask chatGPT to refactor it or in worst case I just do it myself, since I'm still a Junior and I hate the feeling when someone need to babysit me even they are willing to do it but I can do it myself by using LLM or googling.\n\n--\n\nOther things is I can use LLM to make query for me in SQL and MongoDb, tbh sometimes I forget the long syntax of both languages when I rarely use it. Then I will take a screenshot of the answer from LLM and save it in my notes app in OneNote or Notion. By doing this way I can quickly find it after.\n\nProgrammers are still humans, so we forget things that we don't do it all the time right?\n\n--\n\nOther things is what do you guys think of Dev who don't use LLM? or rarely use it.\n\nThey prefer reading the doc/googling first and if they cant, then they wil use LLM as their last option.\n\nTbh I find it very nice, but the problem is the right \"keyword\" to find/google that will fix the problem which is time consuming!",

Then I spent at least 30 minutes listening to them tell me to type something and do this and that and see if that fixed it. Each time my answer was... the keyboard does not work. Then they would say, have you tried ctrl/alt/delete... my answer was... the keyboard does not work. Then they would say... restart the computer and hold down the F1 key... my answer... the keyboard does not work. They would say... go to the website and download a new driver. My answer was... how do I would that when the keyboard does not work? After about 30 minutes... the lady finally got to the menu item that said... the motherboard is bad. My only response was... yeah, go figure.\\n    \\n      This is pretty much my experiance with ChatGPT prompts and code generation.

So instead of needing to carry things all day, you now had machines that did that for you. So now you didn't have to deal with physical exhaustion, so you could work longer hours.\\n\\nThis has some similarity to what will happen with AI in software engineering, but not a ton. There's not a lot that AI can completely automate for you with coding, primarily because you just can't trust it.\\n\\nLLMs are an untestable black box. Sure, the LLM can quote specific parts of a PDF or search the web. But it can misinterpret those results, randomly bork unexpectedly on certain inputs, or just hallucinate completely. We have lots of wonderful constructed benchmarks that evaluate various metrics. But these metrics are hyper-specific to those specific benchmarks, because performance varies widely depending on input, temperature, prompt, and seed. These things are huge and you objectively cannot reason about them the same way you can a complex software system. The testing space is infinitely higher. So smart companies will use this to make coding just a little bit faster, but won't be replacing engineers anytime soon. You need someone to blame / fire when things go wrong.",

I don't care how friendly you think your company is, their primary motivation is to make profit, period. If a handful of expert senior developers can be trained into so-called prompt engineers, why would it ever be in their interest to hire enough people for a traditional team?

    "content": "I've been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it's evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It's like we're hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.\n\nThat's a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn't there yet.\n\nSo yeah, the tech is cool and it'll keep getting better, but the progress isn't revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers' lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It's great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won't be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.\n\nI know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Not even playing a game mind you, just giving a text explanation for different lines\n    \n      Like I wanted to have it go into the actual thought processes behind why certain moves follow others & such. If you read the wikibooks chess opening theory on the Sicilian it does that pretty well, that is,m in terms of the logic behind when you defend certain things, bring out certain things at the time you do, branch points where you get to make a decision. I was hoping it could distill that info from the internet for arbitrary lines. But it couldn't even keep track of the lines themselves or valid moves properly\n    \n      Mind you this is stuff that's actually REALLY HARD to extract good info from on Google on your own, at least in my experience. there's so much similar info, things that might mention a line in passing but not delve into it, etc. Should be perfect for this use case. I guess the long lines of move notation don't play well with how it tokenizes things?
