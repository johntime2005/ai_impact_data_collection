But I think there will be room for robot leagues because it'd still be cool to watch human looking machines doing sick moves and having crazy speed and reacting times. Same as I think it'd be great if we had leagues or a different version of the Olympics that allowed performance enhancing drugs.\n\nAI and superhuman leagues would probably not get more popular than the regular leagues, but I think there'd be a niche for them.\n\nPro gaming already shows us what this future would look like for sports: the fact that there are AIs that can destroy pros and how the pros themselves can play StarCraft, CSGO, etc with seemingly superhuman abilities doesn't stop others from wanting to compete and the pro leagues aren't more popular than the game is overall in and of itself. But it's still fun and interesting to watch people who can push the limits. Watching bots push the limits is interesting from a technical perspective.\n\nAnother more direct analogy is chess. Chess has now been solved for all practical purposes with AI. Top AI can now trounce top grandmasters and even uses tactics and strategies that very experienced players have never seen and wouldn't even be able to even use because they require more working memory than humans, even top players, have.
