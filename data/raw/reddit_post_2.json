  "title": "Why are AI companies obsessed with replacing software engineers?",
  "content": "AI is naturallly great at tasks like administrative support, data analysis, research organization, technical writing, and even math—skills that can streamline workflows and drive revenue. There are several jobs that AI can already do very well.\n\nSo why are companies so focused on replacing software engineers first?? Why are the first AI agents coming out \"AI programmers\"?\n\nAI is poorly suited for traditional software engineering. It lacks the ability to understand codebase context, handle complex system design, or resolve ambiguous requirements—key parts of an engineer's job. While it performs well on well-defined tasks like coding challenges, it fails with the nuanced, iterative problem-solving real-world development requires.\n\nYet, unlike many mindless desk jobs, or even traditional IT jobs, software engineers seem to be the primary target for AI replacement. Why?? It feels like they just want to get rid of us at this point imo",

My dad is an adjunct professor, he has a huge problem with students turning in AI generated code (his solution is to make homework optional and make everything exam - which he hates doing, since some students won't do the homework and it puts a lot of pressure on those who have test anxiety, but... what else can you do?) who can't explain why their code does what it does or even what the individual parts of it do.\n\nI think we're about to hit a point where the old school problem with people \"faking\" their credentials is about to get 10x worse with people who have real credentials for fake skills.",

Essentially a return to serfdom where property ownership is no longer something you can work towards. This is not an if, it's a when.

Maybe a new AI math structure will be far more accessible to other companies in the future.\n\nTech company labor is dominated by software engineers. Get rid of them and you'll cut no-value-added costs by like 80-95%. No office buildings, office furniture, or office hardware, or janitors for offices needed, or secretaries, or HR, if you have no devs in the office anymore.\n\nErgo, tech company saves a ton of money by automating their labor. Even more money can go into training AI and selling AI (which the AI might be able to sell itself).\n\nAlso, any AI capable of actually replacing a developer (not a copypasta dev, but someone who creates novel solutions to problems using software) is also an AI that can very, very likely be tuned to solve non-coding problems with code.\n\nAI practically flies planes from start to finish. What other things can AI+hardware do that humans already do? Warehouse workers are currently targets, as are drivers, and food makers. Teachers and tutors are already under attack.\n\nCan AI be used to replace those humans, too? Definitely—if it is advanced enough to replace devs, it's advanced enough to replace most people's jobs given the right hardware.\n\nThe only problem these companies have is... they released the right product under the wrong promise. The product that is LLMs is great for what they do, but a farcry from replacing people. They're now all scrambling to prove their LLMs can replace people, like they promised it would. The goalposts on expectations are still getting walked back to, \"Enhancing productivity,\" rather than replacing workers.",
