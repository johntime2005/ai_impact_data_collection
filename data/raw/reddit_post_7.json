  "title": "Be totally honest, people who are at least Mid level, do you guys use LLM e.g. chatGPT? and what do you use it for? And what do you guys think of Dev who don't use LLM?",
  "content": "I am a new Grad and just joined a company for 2 months so far so I'm a Junior and I have to be honest all of my tickets I just use first ChatGPT or other LLM. And googling if those LLM doesn't fix my problems.\n\nI just tell them for example there is a bug on this snippet code**, it return X result but I want this desired Y result s. Fix it for me,** and I just test the code and see if it fixed the bugs, if it does fix the bug then,\n\nI ask chatGPT to refactor it or in worst case I just do it myself, since I'm still a Junior and I hate the feeling when someone need to babysit me even they are willing to do it but I can do it myself by using LLM or googling.\n\n--\n\nOther things is I can use LLM to make query for me in SQL and MongoDb, tbh sometimes I forget the long syntax of both languages when I rarely use it. Then I will take a screenshot of the answer from LLM and save it in my notes app in OneNote or Notion. By doing this way I can quickly find it after.\n\nProgrammers are still humans, so we forget things that we don't do it all the time right?\n\n--\n\nOther things is what do you guys think of Dev who don't use LLM? or rarely use it.\n\nThey prefer reading the doc/googling first and if they cant, then they wil use LLM as their last option.\n\nTbh I find it very nice, but the problem is the right \"keyword\" to find/google that will fix the problem which is time consuming!",
