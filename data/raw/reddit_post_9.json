I don't think it will replace the ENTIRETY of programmers, at least for the foreseeable future.\n\nDecrease the numbers? Sure, seems reasonable. Wipe all of them out? Don't think so.\n\nCalculators made Maths much easier, never replaced it. They made the jobs of Mathematicians and Accountants easier, It never replaced them.\n\nBut in the end, no one truly knows. My opinion could be right, or wrong.

So now you didn't have to deal with physical exhaustion, so you could work longer hours.\n\nThis has some similarity to what will happen with AI in software engineering, but not a ton. There's not a lot that AI can completely automate for you with coding, primarily because you just can't trust it.\n\nLLMs are an untestable black box. Sure, the LLM can quote specific parts of a PDF or search the web. But it can misinterpret those results, randomly bork unexpectedly on certain inputs, or just hallucinate completely. We have lots of wonderful constructed benchmarks that evaluate various metrics. But these metrics are hyper-specific to those specific benchmarks, because performance varies widely depending on input, temperature, prompt, and seed. These things are huge and you objectively cannot reason about them the same way you can a complex software system. The testing space is infinitely higher. So smart companies will use this to make coding just a little bit faster, but won't be replacing engineers anytime soon.

Either you're crazy wealthy with lots of existing resources and can prove some worth to the elite, or you're joining the rest of the world and fighting for scraps.\n\nAgain, completely fictional, bypassing the entire transition period.

Maybe in a few decades people will want to immigrate from the west to Asian countries with falling birthrates to work in factories in LCOL areas, the way Asians immigrate to the west to HCOL. The population crisis in many Asian countries is quite evident. Japan, for example, tries to hire tech workers from New Zealand and Australia. Asian countries also have language-specific needs that LLM's trained in English may not necessarily reach very quickly. And those jobs aren't paying cents on the dollar anymore. Wages have been rising in countries like China, which is why they moved to other Asian countries. But now they're rising there too, which is why companies are trying to make India the 'next' China. It doesn't seem to be going well.\n    \n      There is potential here. And I'll admit my situation is far-fetched.

Of course AI won't replace all developers, and who knows how long it'll take to get there, but it will certainly give companies more of an incentive to hire fewer developers, if not downsize altogether. I don't care how friendly you think your company is, their primary motivation is to make profit, period. If a handful of expert senior developers can be trained into so-called prompt engineers, why would it ever be in their interest to hire enough people for a traditional team? Hell, given enough time, I can even foresee non-technical folk grasping enough of the basics to generate code themselves before sending it off to a \"real developer\" who now gets to take on the fun task of debugging whatever trash the AI spits out. If this is your ideal future, more power to you I guess.\n\nThis isn't like the calculator. Efficiency will not necessarily make our lives as programmers easier, it just gives us the ability to be even more overworked. Companies will catch on to this apparent free time AI frees up. \"You just have to generate and debug, right? Perfect!
