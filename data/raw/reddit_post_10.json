  "title": "The fact that ChatGPT 5 is barely an improvement shows that AI won't replace software engineers.",
  "content": "I've been keeping an eye on ChatGPT as it's evolved, and with the release of ChatGPT 5, it honestly feels like the improvements have slowed way down. Earlier versions brought some pretty big jumps in what AI could do, especially with coding help. But now, the upgrades feel small and kind of incremental. It's like we're hitting diminishing returns on how much better these models get at actually replacing real coding work.\n\nThat's a big deal, because a lot of people talk like AI is going to replace software engineers any day now. Sure, AI can knock out simple tasks and help with boilerplate stuff, but when it comes to the complicated parts such as designing systems, debugging tricky issues, understanding what the business really needs, and working with a team, it still falls short. Those things need creativity and critical thinking, and AI just isn't there yet.\n\nSo yeah, the tech is cool and it'll keep getting better, but the progress isn't revolutionary anymore. My guess is AI will keep being a helpful assistant that makes developers' lives easier, not something that totally replaces them. It's great for automating the boring parts, but the unique skills engineers bring to the table won't be copied by AI anytime soon. It will become just another tool that we'll have to learn.\n\nI know this post is mainly about the new ChatGPT 5 release, but TBH it seems like all the other models are hitting diminishing returns right now as well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I suspect that we've already hit the limits of what LLMs can do effectively.

Not even playing a game mind you, just giving a text explanation for different lines\n    \n      Like I wanted to have it go into the actual thought processes behind why certain moves follow others & such. If you read the wikibooks chess opening theory on the Sicilian it does that pretty well, that is,m in terms of the logic behind when you defend certain things, bring out certain things at the time you do, branch points where you get to make a decision. I was hoping it could distill that info from the internet for arbitrary lines. But it couldn't even keep track of the lines themselves or valid moves properly\n    \n      Mind you this is stuff that's actually REALLY HARD to extract good info from on Google on your own, at least in my experience. there's so much similar info, things that might mention a line in passing but not delve into it, etc. Should be perfect for this use case. I guess the long lines of move notation don't play well with how it tokenizes things? Or maybe too much info is locked behind paid content or YouTube videos instead of actually written out in books or in public",

Admittedly, I'm not super knowledgeable in this area, so I wasn't totally following, but I think this is where agentic AI comes in (specialized smaller models working together inside a bigger model).\n\nI think I agree with your assessment.
