  "title": "Do you feel the vibe shift introduced by GPT-5?",
  "content": "A lot of people have been expecting a stagnation in LLM progress, and while I've thought that a stagnation was somewhat likely, I've also been open to the improvements just continuing. I think the release of GPT-5 was the nail in the coffin that proved that the stagnation is here. For me personally, the release of this model feels significant because I think it proved without a doubt that \"AGI\" is not really coming anytime soon.\n\nLLMs are starting to feel like a totally amazing technology (I've probably used an LLM almost every single day since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022) that is maybe on the same scale as the internet, but it won't change the world in these insane ways that people have been speculating on...\n\nWe won't solve all the world's diseases in a few years\n\nWe won't replace all jobs\n\nSoftware Engineering as a career is not going anywhere, and neither is other \"advanced\" white collar jobs\n\nWe won't have some kind of rogue superintelligence\n\nPersonally, I feel some sense of relief. I feel pretty confident now that it is once again worth learning stuff deeply, focusing on your career etc. AGI is not coming!",
