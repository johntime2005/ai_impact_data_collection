Then I spent at least 30 minutes listening to them tell me to type something and do this and that and see if that fixed it. Each time my answer was... the keyboard does not work. Then they would say, have you tried ctrl/alt/delete... my answer was... the keyboard does not work. Then they would say... restart the computer and hold down the F1 key... my answer... the keyboard does not work. They would say... go to the website and download a new driver. My answer was... how do I would that when the keyboard does not work? After about 30 minutes... the lady finally got to the menu item that said... the motherboard is bad. My only response was... yeah, go figure.\n    \n      This is pretty much my experiance with ChatGPT prompts and code generation.
