  "title": "Softbank: 1,000 AI agents replace 1 job. One billion AI agents are set to be deployed this year. \"The era of human programmers is coming to an end\", says Masayoshi Son",
  "content": "https://www.heise.de/en/news/Softbank-1-000-AI-agents-replace-1-job-10490309.html\n\ntldr: Softbank founder Masayoshi Son recently said, "The era when humans program is nearing its end within our group." He stated that Softbank is working to have AI agents completely take over coding and programming, and this transition has already begun.\n\nAt a company event, Son claimed it might take around 1,000 AI agents to replace a single human employee due to the complexity of human thought. These AI agents would not just automate coding, but also perform broader tasks like negotiations and decision-making—mostly for other AI agents.\n\nHe aims to deploy the first billion AI agents by the end of 2025, with trillions more to follow, suggesting a sweeping automation of roles traditionally handled by humans. No detailed timeline has been provided.\n\nThe announcement has implications beyond just software engineering, but it could especially impact how the tech industry views the future of programming careers.",
